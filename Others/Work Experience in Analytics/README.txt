During the junior year of BE in Information Technology, I founded a consulting firm, Levigran Business Efficiency Solutions, that offered analytics services to manufacturing companies for their SCM function.

As the technology end of the firm I worked with our team of Operations Research experts in enhancing the profitability of our clients' global supply chains by modeling the internal flow of information and material and the external variability in demand, costs, availability etc. 

A description of my work at Levigran is in the document, "Shaping Business Outcomes from a CXO perspective"
