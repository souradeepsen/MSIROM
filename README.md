I've included sample code for the languages I work with. 

The Others folders contains a short slide deck based on the clustering analysis done in SAS and a description of applications I developed for the consulting firm I founded during my undergraduate years.  

I am in the process of the developing my skills in Python and will soon be uploading some of my work in it.
